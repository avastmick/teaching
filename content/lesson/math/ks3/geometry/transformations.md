## Terminology

What is it?

___

## Terminology

- Jargon
- Special words that describe something

---

## Transformations

Terms to know:

point; vertex; rotate; reflect; translate; symmetry; vector; line

---

## Points and Vertices

### Points

- What is a point?
- How do we measure it?

___

## Points

- A point is a location on a graph.
- It is measured by its **coordinate**. 
- A *coordinate* is the measurement of distance along one *axis* compared to another.
- An *axis* is usually marked by ``x`` or ``y``
- A *coordinate* is given by ``(x, y)``

___

## Points

A chart: ``y = 2x``
