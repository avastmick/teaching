# Computers

## What is the purpose of a computer?

&#43; In pairs, discuss and come up with an answer. 
    &#43; [Two minutes]
&#43; One person from each pair write the answers on whiteboard.

___

## The Answer

- All the answers lead to the right one
    &#43; **Automation!!**
    &#43; Computers do work we find boring, repetitious or difficult.

___

## Name the oldest computers.

&#43; In pairs again
    &#43; [two minutes]
&#43; One person from each pair write the answers on whiteboard.

___

## Older than you may think

&#43; **Neolithic standing stones** - tens of thousands of years old.
&#43; **The abacus** - thousands of years old.
&#43; Computers have been around a long time!!

___

## Rock

Neolithic standing stones helped prehistoric people to work out when to plant crops or go hunting.

___

## Wooden

The abacus was an old computer used to make difficult trading calculations easier to remember and record.

# Code (or Software) 

## How do we get computers to do work for us?

&#43; **Code!!!**
&#43; Prehistoric people coded in rocks!
&#43; Ancient traders coded in wooden counters!
&#43; Modern people code in text

---

## Coding Languages

### Code can be written in many languages

These are called programming languages, or computer languages.

How many programming languages can you name?

___

## Code Syntax

Each programming language has a set of rules, called **syntax**.

Syntax defines the structure, symbols, key words and terms used to create instruction sets, or **programmes**.

___

## Hello World! 

- When we learn a new computer language we must learn its &#34;syntax&#34;.
- The first step in learning any language is to say hello.
- A programming language is the same
    &#43; It&#39;s tradition to get the computer to say ``Hello World!``

---

## Practical

- Today we are going to use **Python**
- Python is used a lot in -
    &#43; Science
    &#43; Statistics
    &#43; Medical research
    &#43; Information Technology

___

## Start your engines!

Open Python IDLE (Python Commandline)

- Should look something like this:

```
Python 2.7.13 (v2.7.13:a06454b1afa1, Dec 17 2016, 20:53:40) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type &#34;help&#34;, &#34;copyright&#34;, &#34;credits&#34; or &#34;license&#34; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
```

___

## Type in some code

Type in: 

```python
&gt;&gt;&gt; print &#34;Hello World!&#34;
```

You should see the computer output: 

```
Hello World!
```

___

## Python is great

- Python is a very simple computer language
- Python is very efficient
- Python is very powerful
- You can do pretty much anything with Python.

---

## Save code in a file 

So, what do you do when you want to write something complicated and use it again?

- You save your work in a file - like you would writing a document in Word or a PPT.
- The format of a python file looks like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

def some_function():
    print &#34;Hello World!!&#34;

some_function()
```

___

## Open an editor

- Open an editor - Open Python IDLE (Python GUI)
- Add in the code
- Save the file 
- Name the file ``HelloWorld.py``

![](images/lessons/intro-to-prog/IDLE-Editor.png)

___

## Run your code

- Run the file by clicking ``Run`` 
- Or hit ``F5``
- The output will be the same - ``Hello World!!``

![](images/lessons/intro-to-prog/Output.png)

___

## Errors

- If you made a mistake, you may get an error...
    &#43; What error did you get and how can you fix them?
        &#43; Look at the error, it will help
- Add an error - leave out a quote mark - and see what happens
- You may see an error for indentation

```python  
&gt;&gt;&gt; print &#34;Hello World!
  File &#34;&lt;stdin&gt;&#34;, line 1
    print &#34;Hello World!
                      ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
```

---

## Indentation

Python **SYNTAX** includes **indentaton**

- This is how the text of the code is laid out
- One instruction may have a sub-instruction
- The sub-instruction **must** be indented

```python
def some_function():
    print &#34;Hello World!!&#34;

↑↑↑↑ indented four characters of whitespace
```

Your indentation **MUST** be consistent, or Python will give you an error!

# Make the computer do the work

Automation is our goal, let&#39;s type less...

----

## Task

How about writing out &#34;Hello World!!&#34; 10 times?

___

## Loops 

You&#39;ll need a loop for that!

```python
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1,10):
...     print &#34;Hello World!!&#34;
```

---

## Task (Hard)

Print out &#34;Hello World!!&#34; for the number of characters in its string

- There are 13 characters in the String
- Each iteration (loop) remove a character so the last iteration is blank

___

## Looks like...

```python
Hello World!! 
Hello World!  
Hello World   
Hello Worl    
Hello Wor     
Hello Wo      
Hello W       
Hello         
Hello         
Hell          
Hel           
He            
H             
```

---

## String manipulation

To do that you need to know a *String* is a list of characters.

- &#34;Hello World!!&#34; is a *String* made up of characters
- &#39;H&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39; &#39;, &#39;W&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;!&#39;, &#39;!&#39;
- This is called a *List* in Python
- In other languages it is called an *Array*

___

## Create a List

```python
hello = list(&#34;Hello World!!&#34;)
```

---

# Challenge

## Prize

If you can solve this you get a prize!!

___

## Logical Code fail

- Why does the following code not do what you think?
- You&#39;d think it works, but it does not - why?

```python
hello = list(&#34;Hello World!!&#34;)
for i in hello:
    if i != hello[0]:
        del hello[-1]
    print &#39;&#39;.join(hello)
```

___

## Solution

```python
hello = list(&#34;Hello World!!&#34;)
strLth = len(hello)
for i in range(0,strLth):
    if i != 0:
        del hello[-1]
    print &#39;&#39;.join(hello)
```

---

# Summary 

- What are computers for? - **Automation**
- How do we control them? - **Code (software)**
- We learnt some *Python*, a simple, but powerful computer language
- We learnt how to control the computer to say **&#34;Hello World!&#34;**
- We learnt how to save our instructions (our code) to a file to use again
- We learnt about errors and logical problems
